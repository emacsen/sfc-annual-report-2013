We here at Conservancy would like to thank all of the donors – both large 
and small – that enabled us to do our work in FY2013.  Some of you
supported us by donating to our member projects; others made general 
contributions.  All of your donations helped us promote, develop, and
defend FLOSS for the public's benefit. 

We also salute the thousands of volunteers – the developers, maintainers, 
designers, documenters, sys admins, and website amdins who support us by 
contributing time, skill, code, and more to our member projects.  
We wouldn't exist without you.  

If you would like to donate to Conservancy, visit us on the web at 
sfconservancy.org/donate/.  If you would like to volunteer for one of our
member projects, you can find links to our member projects' websites at 
http://sfconservancy.org/members/current/.  And, if you would like to 
contribute to Conservancy in other ways, contact us at 
volunteer@sfconservancy.org.
